Cooking the algorithms with a bit of DS and fantasy !

You'll be able to find multiple categories under the source package :
- Arrays
- Backtracking
- Binary Tree
- Data Structures implementation
- Dynamic Programming
- Graphs
- Map
- Numbers
- Sorting
- Strings

Current work :
- documentation of each algorithm (In Progress)
- addition of new algorithms (mostly DP, Graphs and String manipulation)
